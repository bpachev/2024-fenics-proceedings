   abstract = {Adult cardiac muscle adapts to mechanical changes in the environment by growth and remodeling (G&R) via a variety of mechanisms. Hypertrophy develops when the heart is subjected to chronic mechanical overload. In ventricular pressure overload (e.g. due to aortic stenosis) the heart typically reacts by concentric hypertrophic growth, characterized by wall thickening due to myocyte radial growth when sarcomeres are added in parallel. In ventricular volume overload, an increase in filling pressure (e.g. due to mitral regurgitation) leads to eccentric hypertrophy as myocytes grow axially by adding sarcomeres in series leading to ventricular cavity enlargement that is typically accompanied by some wall thickening. The specific biomechanical stimuli that stimulate different modes of ventricular hypertrophy are still poorly understood. In a recent study, based on in vitro studies in micropatterned myocyte cell cultures subjected to stretch, we proposed that cardiac myocytes grow longer to maintain a preferred sarcomere length in response to increased fiber strain and grow thicker to maintain interfilament lattice spacing in response to increased cross-fiber strain. Here, we test whether this growth law is able to predict concentric and eccentric hypertrophy in response to aortic stenosis and mitral valve regurgitation, respectively, in a computational model of the adult canine heart coupled to a closed loop model of circulatory hemodynamics. A non-linear finite element model of the beating canine ventricles coupled to the circulation was used. After inducing valve alterations, the ventricles were allowed to adapt in shape in response to mechanical stimuli over time. The proposed growth law was able to reproduce major acute and chronic physiological responses (structural and functional) when integrated with comprehensive models of the pressure-overloaded and volume-overloaded canine heart, coupled to a closed-loop circulation. We conclude that strain-based biomechanical stimuli can drive cardiac growth, including wall thickening during pressure overload. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Abe&&-Growth and remodeling in tissues may be modulated by mechanical factors such as stress. For example, in cardiac hypertrophy, alterations in wall stress arising from changes in mechanical loading lead to cardiac growth and remodeling. A general continuum formulation for finite volumetric growth in sotI elastic tissues is therefore proposed. The shape change of an unloaded tissue during growth is described by a mapping analogous to the deformation gradient tensor. This mapping is decomposed into a transformation of the local zero-stress reference state and an accompanying elastic deformation that ensures the compatibility of the total growth deformation. Residual stress arises from this elastic deformation. Hence, a complete kinematic formulation for growth in general requires a knowledge of the constitutive law for stress in the tissue. Since growth may in turn be affected by stress in the tissue, a general form for the stressdependent growth law is proposed as a relation between the symmetric growth-rate tensor and the stress tensor. With a thick-walled hollow cylinder of incompressible, isotropic hyperelastic material as an example, the mechanics of left ventricular hypertrophy are investigated. The results show that transmurally uniform pure circumferential growth, which may be similar to eccentric ventricular hypertrophy, changes the state of residual stress in the heart wall. A model of axially loaded bone is used to test a simple stress-dependent growth law in which growth rate depends on the difference between the stress due to loading and a predetermined growth equilibrium stress.},

   abstract = {We present a novel computational model for maladaptive cardiac growth in which kinematic changes of the cardiac chambers are attributed to alterations in cytoskeletal architecture and in cellular morphology. We adopt the concept of finite volume growth characterized through the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into an elastic part and a growth part. The functional form of its growth tensor is correlated to sarcomerogenesis, the creation and deposition of new sarcomere units. In response to chronic volume-overload, an increased diastolic wall strain leads to the addition of sarcomeres in series, resulting in a relative increase in cardiomyocyte length, associated with eccentric hypertrophy and ventricular dilation. In response to chronic pressure-overload, an increased systolic wall stress leads to the addition of sacromeres in parallel, resulting in a relative increase in myocyte cross sectional area, associated with concentric hypertrophy and ventricular wall thickening. The continuum equations for both forms of maladaptive growth are discretized in space using a nonlinear finite element approach, and discretized in time using the implicit Euler backward scheme. We explore a generic bi-ventricular heart model in response to volume- and pressure-overload to demonstrate how local changes in cellular morphology translate into global alterations in cardiac form and function. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Therefore, we adapted a published growth relation for use in a compartmental model of the left ventricle (LV). The model was coupled to a circuit model of the circulation to simulate hemodynamic overload in dogs. We automatically tuned control and acute model parameters based on experimentally reported hemodynamic data and fit growth parameters to changes in LV dimensions from two experimental overload studies (one pressure, one volume). The fitted model successfully predicted the reported time course of LV dilation and thickening not only in independent studies of pressure and volume overload but also following myocardial infarction. Implemented in MATLAB on a desktop PC, the model required just 6 min to simulate 3 months of growth.},

   abstract = {In this paper we formulate a geometric theory of the mechanics of growing solids. Bulk growth is modeled by a material manifold with an evolving metric. The time dependence of the metric represents the evolution of the stress-free (natural) configuration of the body in response to changes in mass density and "shape". We show that the time dependency of the material metric will affect the energy balance and the entropy production inequality; both the energy balance and the entropy production inequality have to be modified. We then obtain the governing equations covariantly by postulating invariance of energy balance under time-dependent spatial diffeomorphisms. We use the principle of maximum entropy production in deriving an evolution equation for the material metric. In the case of isotropic growth, we find those growth distributions that do not result in residual stresses. We then look at Lagrangian field theory of growing elastic solids. We will use the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle with Rayleigh's dissipation functions to derive the governing equations. We make an explicit connection between our geometric theory and the conventional multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, F=F e F g, into growth and elastic parts. We linearize the nonlinear theory and derive a linearized theory of growth mechanics. Finally, we obtain the stress-free growth distributions in the linearized theory. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

   abstract = {Size regulation in living organisms is a major unsolved problem in developmental biology. This is due to the intrinsic complexity of biological growth, which simultaneously involves genetic, biochemical, and mechanical factors. In this article, we propose a novel theoretical framework that explores the role of incompatibility, the geometric source of residual stress in a growing body, as a possible regulator of size termination during development. We explore this paradigm both at the level of a model 2D cell, and at the level of continuous tissues. After establishing a parallel between incompatibility and the shape parameter of vertex models, we show that incompatibility-driven growth leads to size control in a model 2D cell. We then extend the same paradigm to the level of continuous bodies, where incompatibility is measured by the Ricci curvature of the growth tensor. By using the model 2D cell as a template, we now derive an evolutionary law for the growth tensor with curvature fixed at a physiological value. When the analysis is specialised to radial symmetry (discs and spheres), this model captures the salient features observed in Drosophila wing discs and multicellular spheroids: these systems have a target size and build up residual stresses that cause the tissue to open in response to a radial cut, with the cut edges curling outward. The theory proposed in this work suggests that incompatibility in a growing biological tissue is potentially controllable at the cell level, and that incompatibility-driven growth provides an effective method of controlling global information (stress, size) through local geometric controls.},

A generalized continuum kinematics is needed to analyze such materials.

The hypothesis we employ states that the strain is uniformly distributed through the wall thickness at the end diastole. In conventional analyses, in contrast, it has been implicitly assumed that an unloading state gives a stress-free configuration. The steep stress distributions obtained from the conventional assumption are considerably reduced in the present study due to our hypothesis. The results are physiologically more plausible.},

Growth is regarded as a deformation that is decomposed into a plastic component which describes unconstrained growth and an elastic component to satisfy continuity of the tissue after growth. In current growth models, a single reference configuration is used that remains fixed throughout the entire growth process. However, considering continuous turnover to occur together with growth, such a fixed reference is unlikely to exist in reality. Therefore, we investigated the effect of tissue turnover on growth by incrementally updating the reference configuration. With both a fixed reference and an updated reference, strain-induced cardiac growth in magnitude of 30% could be simulated. However, with an updated reference, the amplitude of the stimulus for growth decreased over time, whereas with a fixed reference this amplitude increased. We conclude that, when modeling volumetric growth, the choice of the reference configuration is of great importance for the computed growth.},

   abstract = {The mechanism by which cells measure the dimension of the organ in which they are embedded, and slow down their growth when the final size is reached, is a long-standing problem of developmental biology. The role of mechanics in this feedback is considered important. Morphoelasticity is a standard continuum framework for modeling growing elastic tissues. However, in this theory, in the absence of additional variables, the feedback between growth and mechanical stress leads to either a collapse or unbounded growth of the tissue, but usually prohibits reaching a finite asymptotic size (‘size control’). In this article, we modify this classical setting to include an energetic cost associated with growth, leading to the physical effect of size control. The present model simultaneously provides a qualitatively correct residual stress profile and has a naturally emerging necrotic core, all of which have previously been experimentally established in multicellular spheroids. This is achieved through a local feedback mechanism derived from a thermodynamical framework. The model delivers testable predictions for experimental systems and could be a step towards the understanding of the role of mechanics in the multifaceted question of how growing organs attain their final size.},

For striated muscle fibers, transverse and longitudinal growth are hypothesized to depend on the active and passive fiber stress, respectively. For smooth muscle fibers in arteries, transverse growth is assumed to depend on the fiber stress (active behavior is ignored), with longitudinal growth depending on both fiber stress and the shear stress on the endothelium due to blood flow. In both types of muscle, the rate of growth is assumed to depend linearly on the stresses. Relatively simple models for skeletal muscle, the heart, and arteries are used to show that the proposed growth laws can predict many of the known characteristics of muscle growth during development and following load perturbations in the mature animal.},

Yet, this configuration cannot exist in Euclidean space, in general, and the mathematical basis for this assumption is on unsatisfactory ground. Here, we derive a sufficient condition for the existence of global intermediate configurations, starting from a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient. We show that these global configurations are unique up to isometry. We examine the result of isometrically embedding these configurations in higher-dimensional Euclidean space, and construct multiplicative decompositions of the deformation gradient reflecting these embeddings. As an example, for a family of radially symmetric deformations, we construct isometric embeddings of the resulting intermediate configurations, and compute the residual stress fields explicitly.},

   abstract = {Morphogenesis, the process of growth and shape formation in biological tissues, is driven by complex interactions between mechanical, biochemical, and genetic factors. Traditional models of biological growth often rely on the concept of homeostatic Eshelby stress, which defines an ideal target state for the growing body. Any local deviation from this state triggers growth and remodelling, aimed at restoring balance between mechanical forces and biological adaptation. Despite its relevance in the biomechanical context, the nature of homeostatic stress remains elusive, with its value and spatial distribution often chosen arbitrarily, lacking a clear biological interpretation or understanding of its connection to the lower scales of the tissue. To bring clarity on the nature of homeostatic stress, we shift the focus from Eshelby stress to growth incompatibility, a measure of geometric frustration in the tissue that is the primary source of residual stresses in the developing body. Incompatibility, measured by the Ricci tensor of the growth metric at the continuous level, can be potentially regulated at the cell level through connections with the surrounding cells, making it a more meaningful concept than homeostatic stress. In this geometric perspective, achieving a homeostatic state corresponds to the establishment of a physiological level of frustration in the body, a process leading to the generation and maintenance of the mechanical stresses that are crucial to tissue functionality. In this work we present a formulation of biological growth that penalises deviations from a desired state of incompatibility, similar to the way the Einstein-Hilbert action operates in General Relativity. The proposed framework offers a clear and physically grounded approach that elucidates the regulation of size and shape, while providing a means to link cellular and tissue scales in biological systems.},
