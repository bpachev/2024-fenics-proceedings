abstract = {We present an analysis of the total free energy of a supercapacitor modelled with a composite diffuse layer (CDL) formed by a steric repulsive potential. The steric potential is modelled with a simple approximation to the Bikerman steric potential, enabling derivation of an analytical expression for the total free energy of the supercapacitor in terms of the size and valency of the electrolyte counterions and electrode potentials. The analytical expression for the total free energy of the supercapacitor matches the exact numerical Bikerman calculation at high potential with relative error close to 1%. This provides an upper bound over the more accurate Carnahan-Starling model. A maximum upper bound for the energy is also provided in the limit where bulk concentrations approach the ion concentration cap. We analyze the relative contribution of the steric interaction to the total free energy. At large voltages, the steric free energy is comparable in magnitude to that of the electrostatic free energy, and introduces ion-size effects in the energy of the supercapacitor. Consequently at high potentials the total free energy exceeds (doubles) the classical energy [Formula presented], indicating that this formula does not correctly describe the available stored energy from the experimentally measured capacitance.},

   abstract = {Significant progress has been made in recent years in theoretical modeling of the electric double layer (EDL), a key concept in electrochemistry important for energy storage, electrocatalysis, and multitudes of other technological applications. However, major challenges remain in understanding the microscopic details of the electrochemical interface and charging mechanisms under realistic conditions. This review delves into theoretical methods to describe the equilibrium and dynamic responses of the EDL structure and capacitance for electrochemical systems commonly deployed for capacitive energy storage. Special emphasis is given to recent advances that intend to capture the nonclassical EDL behavior such as oscillatory ion distributions, polarization of nonmetallic electrodes, charge transfer, and various forms of phase transitions in the micropores of electrodes interfacing with an organic electrolyte or ionic liquid. This comprehensive analysis highlights theoretical insights into predictable relationships between materials characteristics and electrochemical performance and offers a perspective on opportunities for further development toward rational design and optimization of electrochemical systems.},

@article{LopezGarciaHornoGrosse2018,
   abstract = {One of the main assumptions of the standard electrokinetic model is that ions behave as point-like entities. In a previous work (López-García, et al., 2015) we removed this assumption and analyzed the influence of finite ionic size on the dielectric and electrokinetic properties of colloidal suspensions using both the Bikerman and the Carnahan–Starling equations for the steric interactions. It was shown that these interactions improved upon the standard model predictions so that the surface potential, electrophoretic mobility, and the conductivity and permittivity increment values were increased. In the present study, we extend our preceding works to systems made of three or more ionic species with different ionic sizes. Under these conditions, the Bikerman and Carnahan–Starling expressions cease to be valid since they were deduced for single-size spheres. Fortunately, the Carnahan–Starling expression has been extended to mixtures of spheres of unequal size, namely the “Boublik–Mansoori–Carnahan–Starling–Leland” (BMCSL) equation of state, making it possible to analyze the most general case. It is shown that the BMCSL expression leads to results that differ qualitatively and quantitatively from the standard electrokinetic model.},

@article{GrayStiles2018,
   abstract = {The description of a conducting medium in thermal equilibrium, such as an electrolyte solution or a plasma, involves nonlinear electrostatics, a subject rarely discussed in the standard electricity and magnetism textbooks. We consider in detail the case of the electrostatic double layer formed by an electrolyte solution near a uniformly charged wall, and we use mean-field or Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory to calculate the mean electrostatic potential and the mean ion concentrations, as functions of distance from the wall. PB theory is developed from the Gibbs variational principle for thermal equilibrium of minimising the system free energy. We clarify the key issue of which free energy (Helmholtz, Gibbs, grand, ...) should be used in the Gibbs principle; this turns out to depend not only on the specified conditions in the bulk electrolyte solution (e.g. fixed volume or fixed pressure), but also on the specified surface conditions, such as fixed surface charge or fixed surface potential. Despite its nonlinearity the PB equation for the mean electrostatic potential can be solved analytically for planar or wall geometry, and we present analytic solutions for both a full electrolyte and for an ionic solution containing only counterions, i.e. ions of sign opposite to that of the wall charge. This latter case has some novel features. We also use the free energy to discuss the inter-wall forces which arise when the two parallel charged walls are sufficiently close to permit their double layers to overlap. We consider situations where the two walls carry equal charges, and where they carry equal and opposite charges.},

   abstract = {Here, we address the impact that steric models, introducing finite ion size effects, have on the contact angle for charged surfaces. We review the two most common steric models, namely the excluded volume (commonly referred to as the Bikerman model) and the Carnahan-Starling (CS) models. We clarify the thermodynamics of the solid–liquid electrolyte interface and show that the common case of an electrolyte reservoir characterized by bulk ion concentrations corresponds to the thermodynamics of the grand potential with fixed ionic chemical potentials. The grand potential gives distinctly different interfacial energies compared to the free energy, which corresponds to a finite number of ions in an electrolyte solution (relevant in nanofluidics, for instance). Steric models may be applied to either thermodynamic scenario, and applications to electrowetting are shown under the grand potential (large droplets with a bulk reservoir in the center). When sufficiently large potentials are applied to conducting electrodes, the steric models, unlike the classical point charge model, introduce ion specificity into the electrowetting contact angle via finite ion sizes, which introduces an asymmetry in the contact angle at positive and negative potentials. For electrowetting on dielectrics (EWOD), the theoretical contact angles match experimental values well until electrode potentials of 240V, with CS performing better than Bikerman. We hypothesize that contact angle saturation at 240V may arise due to a switch in the thermodynamics of the solid–liquid interfacial energy from grand potential (bulk reservoir) to free energy (finite ion number) conditions, capping the formation of a counterion adsorption layer at the electrode surface.},

   abstract = {We resolve a thermodynamic inconsistency in previous theoretical descriptions of the free energy of chemisorption (charge regulation) under conditions where nonelectrostatic physisorption is included, as applied to surface forces and particle-particle interactions. We clarify the role of nonelectrostatic ion physisorption energies and show that a term previously thought to represent physisorbed ion concentrations (activities) should instead be interpreted as a "partial ion activity" based solely on the electrostatic physisorption energy and bulk concentration, or alternatively on the nonelectrostatic physisorption energy and surface concentration. Second, the chemisorption energy must be understood as the change in chemical potential after subtracting the electrostatic energy, not subtracting the physisorption energy. Consequently, a previously reported specific ion nonelectrostatic physisorption contribution to the chemisorption free energy is annulled. We also report a correction to the calculation of surface charge. The distinction in "partial ion activity" evaluated from bulk concentration or from surface concentration opens a way to study nonequilibrium forces where chemisorption is in equilibrium with physisorbed ions but not in equilibrium with bulk ions, e.g., by a jump in ion concentrations.},

The Gaussian radii obtained can be used for computation of nonelectrostatic ion-ion dispersion forces that underlie Hofmeister specific ion effects. Equivalent hard-sphere radii are also derived, and these are in reasonable agreement with crystalline ionic radii. The Born electrostatic self-energy is derived for a Gaussian model of the electronic charge distribution. It is shown that the ionic volumes used in electrostatic calculations of strongly hydrated cosmotropic ions ought best to include the first hydration shell. Ionic volumes for weakly hydrated chaotropic metal cations should exclude electron overlap (in electrostatic calculations). Spherical radii are calculated as well as nonisotropic ellipsoidal radii for nonspherical ions, via their nonisotropic static polarizability tensors.},

Unlike perturbation methods, the HAM has nothing to do with small/large physical parameters. In addition, it provides great freedom to choose the equation-type of linear sub-problems and the base functions of a solution. Above all, it provides a convenient way to guarantee the convergence of a solution. This book consists of three parts. Part I provides its basic ideas and theoretical development. Part II presents the HAM-based Mathematica package BVPh 1.0 for nonlinear boundary-value problems and its applications. Part III shows the validity of the HAM for nonlinear PDEs, such as the American put option and resonance criterion of nonlinear travelling waves. New solutions to a number of nonlinear problems are presented, illustrating the originality of the HAM. Mathematica codes are freely available online to make it easy for readers to understand and use the HAM. This book is suitable for researchers and postgraduates in applied mathematics, physics, nonlinear mechanics, finance and engineering.Dr. Shijun Liao, a distinguished professor of Shanghai Jiaotong University, is a pioneer of the HAM.},
